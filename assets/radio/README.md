# Intro radio bed

Ambient audio plays **during the main intro** (low volume, looped).

## Drop your own (ElevenLabs, etc.)

Put a file here:

- `chatter.mp3` / `chatter.ogg` — needs `pip install pygame`
- `chatter.wav` — works with built-in Windows `winsound` (no extra deps)

**Tips for ElevenLabs**

- 45–90 second seamless-ish loop
- Mono, radio EQ (tinny), light static
- Fake chatter only — no real ATC recordings
- Keep under ~3–5 MB if you commit to git

The newest matching file wins (except the auto-generated `hf_bed.wav`).

## Default

The app synthesizes `hf_bed.wav`, a quiet room tone. It's meant to sit
at the edge of hearing, so it isn't described further here — turn it up
if you want to know what's in it.

Heads up: any `.wav` you put in this folder is used as a looping
ambience bed. Don't park one-shot sounds here.

User-supplied ambient loops in this folder still override the default
(if present).

## Mute

Closing the intro (or taking the sector) stops the bed.

**Sector-open sound** is separate: `assets/door_chime.wav` — a short two-note
MTA / LIRR-style door chime (ding-dong), not a long ARTCC ringer. Generated
in `lib/theme.py` (`synthesize_door_chime`).
